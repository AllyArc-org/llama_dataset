# Dataset Card for Llama Mode Dataset

## Dataset Details

### Dataset Description

The Llama Mode dataset is a specialized educational dataset designed to facilitate the development of AI models for interactive learning with a focus on engaging students with diverse needs, including those in Special Educational Needs (SEN) education. This dataset contains prompts and responses paired with educational strategies and their applications, particularly structured to assist and support learning in an educational chatbot context.

- **Curated by:** Zainab Fahim
- **Language(s) (NLP):** English
- **License:** [MIT License]

### Dataset Sources

- **Repository:** [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AllyArc/chat_dataset)

## Uses

### Direct Use

The Llama Mode dataset is designed for use in training conversational AI models that:
- Engage in meaningful and educational dialogues with students.
- Apply educational strategies to enhance learning experiences.
- Adapt responses to cater to students' individual learning styles and needs.

### Out-of-Scope Use

This dataset should not be used for:
- Non-educational applications of AI.
- Chatbots or AI systems not designed to be sensitive to the diverse needs of learners.
- Situations where it may replace human judgement and interaction in critical educational decisions.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is structured into several fields that include:
- `prompt`: The initial query or statement that starts the educational dialogue.
- `response`: The conversational AI's response to the prompt, designed to be informative and engaging.
- `educational_strategy`: The teaching method or approach used in the response.
- `application`: A brief explanation of how the educational strategy is applied in the context of the dialogue, particularly for SEN education.

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

The dataset was curated to enhance AI-driven educational chatbots' ability to deliver personalized learning experiences and to implement various educational strategies effectively.

### Source Data

#### Data Collection and Processing

Data collection involved the development of educational prompts and responses by a team of SEN educators and AI developers, ensuring each interaction is purposeful and strategy-driven.

#### Who are the source data producers?

The dataset was produced collaboratively by the Web scraping and using multi AI agent framework

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

Care has been taken to minimize bias and to ensure inclusivity. However, the dataset's scope is limited to educational content and strategies, and it should be used as a supplement to human educational interaction and not as a replacement.

## Recommendations

Educators and developers using the Llama Mode dataset should be aware of its educational focus and ensure that AI models trained with this data are used responsibly in educational settings.
